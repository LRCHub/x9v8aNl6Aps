[00:07.60] O la da da dada
[00:11.77] Yeah me and you in summer paradise
[00:14.63] My heart is sinking as I'm lifting

[00:25.37] And I can't believe I'm leaving
[00:29.95] Oh I don't kno-kno-know what I'm gonna do
[00:36.62] But, someday
[00:40.00] I will find my way back to
[00:42.55] Where your name is written in the sand
[00:50.01] 'Cause I remember every sunset (I remember)
[00:53.47] I remember every word you said

[01:13.83] I'll be there in a heartbeat
[01:16.11] And I'll be there I'll be there I'll be there

[01:41.85] Where real life can wait (Real life can wait)
[01:44.85] We're crashing like waves (Crashing like waves)
[01:47.88] Playing in the sand (Playing in the sand)
[01:50.62] Holding your hands
